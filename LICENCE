Formalities
-----------

Individual files generally contain the following tag (or similar)
in the copyright notice, instead of the full licence grant text:
  SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
As is conventional, this should be read as a licence grant.

Contributions to Otter are accepted based on the git commit
Signed-off-by convention, by which the contributors' certify their
contributions according to the Developer Certificate of Origin version
1.1 - see the file DEVELOPER-CERTIFICATE.

If you create a new file please be sure to add an appropriate licence
header, probably something like this:
// Copyright by contributors to the Otter game system
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
// There is NO WARRANTY.


Partial dual licence
--------------------

Some individual files are dual-licenced and say
  "MIT-0 OR AGPL-3.0-or-later"
Those files are available under the MIT-0 permissive licence when
taken separately, but when distributed as part of Otter, they are
AGPLv3+.

The imported git subtree webassembly-types/ is by 01Alchemist and is
available under the MIT licence (SPDX "MIT").  Again, when distributed
as part of Otter, this is AGPLv3+.
