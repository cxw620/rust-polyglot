### THIS IS A DRAFT - FOR REVIEW BY THE RUST COMMUNITY

I would greatly appreciate feedback from fellow Rustaceans.

I am interested in reports of any or all of
 * Technical errors
 * Significant omissions
 * Duplication, redundancy, verbosity, or otioseness
 * Differences of opinion especially about crate recommendations,

See the [Colophon](colophon.md) for information about contributing
including a link to the Gitlab repo.

I hope to remove the "draft" label and
release this document to a general audience
soon after Thursday the 23rd of September.
